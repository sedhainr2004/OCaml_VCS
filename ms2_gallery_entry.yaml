Our project is a version control system supplemented by a text editor, designed for managing and analyzing files. It allows users to save versions of files with a custom message, retrieve and restore saved versions, delete specific versions, and display all saved versions in a log. The system’s command-based interface makes it intuitive for users to perform these operations efficiently.
Version Control Commands:
	•	give: Saves a new version of files with a specified commit message.
	•	get: Retrieves a specific version of files based on the given ID.
	•	del: Deletes a specific version based on the provided ID.
	•	show: Displays all saved versions of the files.
	•	diff: Shows the differences between two versions of a file.
	•	changes: Checks for changes in tracked files.
Editor Commands:
	•	find: Replaces target text with replacement text in a file (optional).
	•	insert <line_number>: Inserts text at the specified line number in the file.
	•	count: Returns the word count for the specified file.
	•	avg: Returns the average number of characters in all files of the record.
	•	common_words: Returns the ‘n’ most common words in all files of the record.
	•	longest_words: Returns the ‘n’ longest words in all files of the record.
	•	line_count: Returns the number of lines in a specified file.
	•	summary: Generates a summary for the file, including word count, line count, and character count.
Each saved version is stored in a uniquely named directory for easy organization and management. A main log file, records.txt, maintains all entries, allowing users to quickly access details about all available versions.
